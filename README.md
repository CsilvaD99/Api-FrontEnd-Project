EldenHub is my Front-End Project for Digital-Crafts, that pulls information from Elden Ring Api(https://eldenring.fanapiscom/).

EldenHub Combines several Html files, stlyes them with css, and uses JavaScrip for Dom manipulation and functionality.

To use Elden Hub simply press any of the categories on the top left to filter content based on desired information. Once all the items are loaded in there is a Dropdown menu that displays all of the cards in the
current webpage for easier and faster access. EldenHub is currently a work in progress and more content is soon to come.
