      <img src="https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/2651908.png" alt="" />
      <p>
        With the vast amount of content in the game Elden Ring, EldenHub
        provides a webpage that has acces to almost all of the content in Elden
        Ring wether you have found them in game or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        EldenHub is my Front-End Project for Digital-Crafts, that pulls
        information from Elden Ring Api(https://eldenring.fanapis.com/).
      </p>
      <p>
        To use Elden Hub simply press any of the categories on the top left to
        filter content based on desired information. Once all the items are
        loaded in there is a Dropdown menu that displays all of the cards in the
        current webpage for easier and faster access. EldenHub is currently a
        work in progress and more content is soon to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        To my Fellow Tarnished, May EldenHub assist you in your search of the
        Elden Ring.

          EldenHub is a Front-End Project, that pulls information from Elden
          Ring Api(https://eldenring.fanapis.com/). EldenHub is in no way funded
          or affiliated with the creators of Elden Ring(FromSoftware) and is in
          no way set up to make any profit. EldenHub's creation was made with
          the sole purpose to visualize my current capabilites as a Front-End
          Developer.
